HeatDissipation-kw-per-tile=Heat cost in kW per tile

[mod-setting-description]
HeatDissipation-kw-per-tile=Counts per tile of heat pipe, and per tile of heating tower (which is 3x3 so 9 tiles). This is the power consumed as long as the heat pipe / tower is above 30C. For comparison, transport belts have heat consumption of 10kW in base Space Age, while pipes are 1kW. From testing, I think 1kW isn't noticeable, while 20kW doubles fuel needs which is still manageable. Fractional values like 0.5kW are allowed.
